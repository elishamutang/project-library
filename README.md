# project-library
Library project from The Odin Project's JavaScript course.

To action:

1. Ensure data from book object is displayed in main container. *New Book div is being created with its info displayed everytime the 'Submit' button is clicked.*

2. Display book dynamically in main element whenever user inserts a new book. *Solved using auto-fit/auto-fill and minmax for grid-items. Alternatively can use media queries but out of scope for this project.*

3. Use grid to dynamically adjust inside main element (i.e resize book 'cards' to fit within main element). *Solved using auto-fit/auto-fill and minmax for grid-items.*

4. Utilize data attributes. Dynamically create data attributes for each "book" object using JS. Ensure there will be a link between myLibrary array and book object in DOM (i.e if a book is to removed from the DOM, that book will also be removed in myLibrary array).

5. *Bug found* > Users able to input pages less than 0.


Future improvements:

1. CSS hover effects for buttons.
