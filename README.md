# project-library
Library project from The Odin Project's JavaScript course.

To action:

1. Ensure data from book object is displayed in main container. *New Book div is being created with its info displayed everytime the 'Submit' button is clicked."

2. Display book dynamically in main element whenever user inserts a new book. *Solved using auto-fit/auto-fill and minmax for grid-items. Alternatively can use media queries but out of scope for this project.*

3. Use grid to dynamically adjust inside main element (i.e resize book 'cards' to fit within main element). *Solved using auto-fit/auto-fill and minmax for grid-items.*


Future improvements:

1. CSS hover effects for buttons.
